# Umbraco Vite Boilerplate

Welcome to the Umbraco Vite Boilerplate! This project provides a template for integrating Vite, a modern front-end build tool, with Umbraco, a popular CMS. This boilerplate aims to streamline your development workflow with fast builds and hot module replacement (HMR) out of the box.

## Features

- **Vite Integration**: Leverage Viteâ€™s fast development server and optimized build process.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Enjoy instant updates in your browser as you develop.
- **Modern JavaScript Support**: Write ES6+, TypeScript, and JSX with minimal configuration.
- **Optimized Production Builds**: Benefit from advanced optimizations like tree-shaking and code splitting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or higher)
- [Umbraco CMS](https://umbraco.com/) (v14 or higher)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/semirhamid/umbraco-vite-boilerplate.git
   cd umbraco-vite-boilerplate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production:**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

## Configuration

### Vite Config

The Vite configuration is located in `vite.config.js`. You can customize it according to your project requirements. By default, the build output is directed to the `wwwroot` directory of your Umbraco project.

### Umbraco Integration

Ensure that your Umbraco views reference the bundled assets from the `wwwroot` directory. You can update the paths in your templates as needed.

### Scripts

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the Vite development server with HMR.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the project for production, outputting files to `wwwroot`.

## Pushing to the Main Branch
